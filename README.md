`pytile` is a simple Python library for retrieving information on
[TileÂ® Bluetooth trackers](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/) (including last
location and more).

This library is built on an unpublished, unofficial Tile API; it may alter or
cease operation at any point.

# NOTE: Version 5.0.0

Version 5.0.0 is a complete re-architecture of `pytile` â€“ as such, the API has changed.
Please read the documentation carefully!

# Python Versions

`pytile` is currently supported on:

- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11

# Installation

```bash
pip install pytile
```

# Usage

## Getting an API Object

`pytile` usage starts with an [`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` â€“
note that this ClientSession is required to properly authenticate the library:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        api = await async_login("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session)


asyncio.run(main())
```

If for some reason you need to use a specific client UUID (to, say, ensure that the
Tile API sees you as a client it's seen before) or a specific locale, you can do
so easily:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        api = await async_login(
            "<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session, client_uuid="MY_UUID", locale="en-GB"
        )


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Getting Tiles

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        api = await async_login("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session)

        tiles = await api.async_get_tiles()


asyncio.run(main())
```

The `async_get_tiles` coroutine returns a dict with Tile UUIDs as the keys and `Tile`
objects as the values.

### The `Tile` Object

The Tile object comes with several properties:

- `accuracy`: the location accuracy of the Tile
- `altitude`: the altitude of the Tile
- `archetype`: the internal reference string that describes the Tile's "family"
- `dead`: whether the Tile is inactive
- `firmware_version`: the Tile's firmware version
- `hardware_version`: the Tile's hardware version
- `kind`: the kind of Tile (e.g., `TILE`, `PHONE`)
- `last_timestamp`: the timestamp at which the current attributes were received
- `latitude`: the latitude of the Tile
- `longitude`: the latitude of the Tile
- `lost`: whether the Tile has been marked as "lost"
- `lost_timestamp`: the timestamp at which the Tile was last marked as "lost"
- `name`: the name of the Tile
- `uuid`: the Tile UUID
- `visible`: whether the Tile is visible in the mobile app

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        api = await async_login("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session)

        tiles = await api.async_get_tiles()

        for tile_uuid, tile in tiles.items():
            print(f"The Tile's name is {tile.name}")
            # ...


asyncio.run(main())
```

In addition to these properties, the `Tile` object comes with an `async_update` coroutine
which requests new data from the Tile cloud API for this Tile:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        api = await async_login("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session)

        tiles = await api.async_get_tiles()

        for tile_uuid, tile in tiles.items():
            await tile.async_update()


asyncio.run(main())
```
