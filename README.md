`pytile` is a simple Python library for retrieving information on
[TileÂ® Bluetooth trackers](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/) (including last
location and more).

This library is built on an unpublished, unofficial Tile API; it may alter or
cease operation at any point.

# PLEASE READ: Version 2.0.0 and Beyond

Version 2.0.0 of `pytile` makes several breaking, but necessary changes:

* Moves the underlying library from
  [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to
  [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Changes the entire library to use `asyncio`
* Makes 3.6 the minimum version of Python required

If you wish to continue using the previous, synchronous version of `pytile`,
make sure to pin version 1.1.0.

# Python Versions

`pytile` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7

However, running the test suite currently requires Python 3.6 or higher; tests
run on Python 3.5 will fail.

# Installation

```python
pip install pytile
```

# Usage

`pytile` starts within an
[aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `ClientSession`:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      # YOUR CODE HERE


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Create a client, initialize it, and get to work:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
    client = pytile.Client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", websession)
    await client.async_init()

    # Get all Tiles associated with an account:
    await client.tiles.all()


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```
